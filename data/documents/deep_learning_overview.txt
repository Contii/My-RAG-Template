Deep learning is a subset of machine learning that uses artificial neural networks with multiple layers to model and understand complex patterns in data. These networks are inspired by the structure and function of the human brain, with interconnected nodes that process information.

Deep learning has achieved remarkable success in various domains including computer vision, natural language processing, and speech recognition. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are particularly effective for image processing, while Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) and Transformers excel at sequential data.

The success of deep learning is largely due to the availability of large datasets, powerful computing resources, and improved algorithms. Popular deep learning frameworks include TensorFlow, PyTorch, and Keras, which make it easier to build and train complex neural networks.
