    <h1>Artificial Intelligence Ethics</h1>
    <p>AI ethics is a branch of ethics specifically concerned with the moral implications and societal impact of artificial intelligence systems.</p>
    
    <h2>Key Principles</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Fairness:</strong> AI systems should treat all individuals and groups equitably</li>
        <li><strong>Transparency:</strong> AI decision-making processes should be explainable and understandable</li>
        <li><strong>Privacy:</strong> Personal data should be protected and used responsibly</li>
        <li><strong>Accountability:</strong> Clear responsibility for AI system outcomes</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>As AI becomes more prevalent in society, addressing these ethical considerations becomes increasingly important for responsible AI development.</p>
